# Description
This is an app designed for tracking expenses. Upon entering the interface, you'll encounter dummy data which you can swipe left to remove. Upon doing so, you'll notice changes in the table above (in portrait mode) or to the left (in landscape mode). The bar chart adjusts dynamically based on your spending levels. You can add expenses via the plus icon in the top right corner, specifying the item, amount, type, and date. The "i" icon in the top right corner provides a brief overview of the app. Notably, both the swipeable pages and the images on the main page feature different speeds of movement, adding a touch of sophistication to the app's design.

# Work in progress

- Add functionality to upload images from the gallery or camera.
- Categorize the chart by date.
- Implement interactive tutorials for dynamic operations instead of an info page.
